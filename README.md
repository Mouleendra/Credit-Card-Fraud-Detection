# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

### Overview:
  The project aims to build an end-to-end system for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The solution will involve collecting and preprocessing transaction data, applying machine learning algorithms for fraud detection, and developing a web-based interface for users. The final product will be deployed using a Flask back-end and MongoDB for data storage.
